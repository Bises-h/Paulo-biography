        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Paulo Coelho was born on August 24, 1947, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, into a conservative Catholic family. From a young age, Coelho exhibited a rebellious and unconventional nature, which often clashed with his parents’ expectations. His desire for creative freedom led to conflicts with them, especially as he sought to pursue a career in writing rather than follow the more traditional paths they had envisioned for him.

In his youth, Coelho’s parents, concerned about his nonconformity, had him committed to a psychiatric hospital at the age of 16 in an attempt to “cure” his rebelliousness. This difficult experience profoundly impacted his outlook on life and would later influence much of his writing. Despite this setback, Coelho continued to pursue his creative ambitions.

Before becoming a novelist, Coelho worked as a lyricist in Brazil’s music industry, where he gained some recognition. He collaborated with famous Brazilian musicians, but it was his spiritual journey and travels during the 1970s, particularly through Europe, that would shape his literary voice. These travels exposed him to various philosophical and mystical traditions, and they would form the foundation for the spiritual themes that would define his later works. 

Coelho’s early life, marked by struggle, rebellion, and personal discovery, set the stage for his later exploration of spirituality, destiny, and the quest for meaning in his novels.</p>

        <h2>Career Beginnings</h2>
        <p>Coelho began his career as a songwriter, working with some of Brazil's top artists. But it was in the late 1980s, after a pilgrimage to Santiago, that he found his true calling as a novelist. His first book, "The Pilgrimage," was followed by his landmark work, "The Alchemist," which made him a global sensation.</p>
